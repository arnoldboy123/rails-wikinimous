# README

This is a rails application I built as part of the Le Wagon bootcamp fullstack challenge.

We are building this to better understand CRUD, MVC and routing in Rails.

Some refactoring that I have done:
- Use `resource` in routing
- Use `before action` in controller
- keeping the code DRY

If you would like to have a look at the app itself, you can run it on `localhost:3000/articles`
